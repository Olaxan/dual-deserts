If you are using Lightweight render pipeline, the demo scenes' models will appear pink/black by default. Switch the materials shader to lwrp variant shaders and everything will be okay. ReBake lightmap if you have any lightmap artifacts. 
There are two LWRP compatible shaders provided 

1. Minimalist Standard LWRP

2. Minimalist Standard Localspace LWRP
